# Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Bluetooth Low Energy Tutorial

## Introduction
The Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense is a powerful development board based on the nRF52840 microcontroller. It features Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) capabilities, making it ideal for creating projects that require wireless communication. In this tutorial, we will explore how to set up and use the Bluetooth functionality of the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you will need the following:

1. Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board.
2. Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) installed on your computer. You can download it from the official Arduino website.
3. USB cable for connecting the Arduino board to your computer.
4. Basic knowledge of the Arduino programming language (C/C++).

## Setting up the Arduino IDE
Before we begin, ensure that you have the latest version of the Arduino IDE installed on your computer. Follow these steps to set up the Arduino IDE for the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense:

1. Connect your Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense to your computer using the USB cable.
2. Open the Arduino IDE.
3. In the Arduino IDE, go to **Tools** > **Board** and select "**Arduino Nano 33 BLE**" from the list of available boards.
4. Choose the appropriate port from the **Tools** > **Port** menu. It should be named something like `/dev/cu.usbmodemXXXXXX` or `COMX`.

Your Arduino IDE is now set up and ready to use with the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense.

## Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Bluetooth Basics
The Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense has built-in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) capabilities. BLE allows the Arduino board to communicate wirelessly with other BLE devices such as smartphones, tablets, and other development boards.

The board's Bluetooth module can act as both a central (client) and peripheral (server) device. As a central device, it can scan and connect to other BLE peripherals. As a peripheral device, it can advertise its services and characteristics to be discovered and connected by other central devices.

## Example: Bluetooth Low Energy Peripheral
Let's start with a simple example to demonstrate how to use the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense as a Bluetooth Low Energy peripheral device.

### Step 1: Setting up the Arduino IDE
1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Go to **File** > **Examples** > **ArduinoBLE** > **Peripheral**.
3. A new sketch window will open with the example code.

### Step 2: Uploading the Code
1. Connect your Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense to your computer using the USB cable.
2. Make sure the correct board and port are selected in the Arduino IDE, as explained in the previous section.
3. Click on the **Upload** button (the right arrow icon) to upload the code to your Arduino board.

### Step 3: Testing the Example
1. Once the code is uploaded, open the **Serial Monitor** in the Arduino IDE by clicking on the magnifying glass icon in the upper-right corner.
2. In the Serial Monitor, make sure the baud rate is set to **9600**.
3. On your smartphone or tablet, enable Bluetooth and open a Bluetooth LE scanner app (such as **nRF Connect** or **LightBlue Explorer**).
4. Scan for nearby BLE devices, and you should see your Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense listed as a peripheral device.
5. Connect to your Arduino device from the app, and you should see the device name and the messages "Hello BLE!" and "Count: X" displayed in the Serial Monitor.
6. Disconnect from the device using the app.

Congratulations! You have successfully used the

 Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense as a Bluetooth Low Energy peripheral.
